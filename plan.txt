- Client-Server
    - Game
        - Player can control a spaceship, shoot projectiles
        - Use realistic-feeling physics simulation (inertia, drag)
    - Networking
       - Client Server
       - Server maintains whether it is in game or not
            - If not in game, accepts client connections to join/leave
            - If in game, receives gamestate updates from clients and broadcasts
            

    - Gamestate
        - Position (x, y)
        - Velocity (x, y)
        - Angle
        - Projectile data 
            - Pos, velocity, who fired 
    
    - Organization
        - Separate network module for sure
            - Allows us to easily send/receive gamestate updates, connect to p2p cluster
